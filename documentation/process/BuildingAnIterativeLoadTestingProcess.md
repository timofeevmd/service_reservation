# **3. Building an Iterative Load Testing Process**

## **3.1 Integrating Load Testing into the Agile Cycle**

In Agile development, load testing should not be an afterthought — it must be integrated into the release pipeline. 
Ideally, performance scenarios should be planned alongside feature development. At minimum, include a performance validation 
phase before each release candidate goes live. The goal is to avoid catching performance issues post-release when fixing 
them becomes more expensive. Align testing cycles with sprint planning and identify critical paths for each release. Use 
test triggers in CI pipelines to run performance checks automatically for major builds. Encourage developers and QA to 
treat performance as a shared responsibility. The earlier load testing is introduced in the lifecycle, the better the 
overall system resilience.

**Goal:** Make performance testing a routine, automated part of Agile delivery, reducing last-minute risks and surprises.

## **3.2 Automation and Scalability of Load Testing**

Manual testing does not scale, especially in a microservice ecosystem. Automation is key. Use containerization (e.g., Docker)
to package your load generation tools and infrastructure. Maintain parameterized JMeter templates and keep test scripts 
under version control (e.g., Git). Automate environment provisioning using tools like Docker Compose or Kubernetes manifests. 
Integrate load tests into CI/CD systems (e.g., GitLab CI, Jenkins) so they can be run on demand or scheduled regularly.
This ensures repeatability and minimizes configuration errors. Scalability is also important — plan how your load generators
can scale horizontally and how your monitoring stack (InfluxDB, Prometheus) handles high data volumes. Well-automated 
frameworks reduce your operational burden and increase test reliability.

**Goal:** Achieve consistent, repeatable, and scalable load testing through smart automation and infrastructure design.

## **3.3 Retrospective and Maturity Growth of Load Testing Practices**

Beyond execution, load testing must evolve as part of a continuous improvement culture. After each major release or incident,
conduct a retrospective focused on performance: what worked, what failed, what was missed. Expand your coverage by introducing 
new scenarios based on production behavior or SLA changes. Maintain a living knowledge base of lessons learned, templates,
and playbooks. Track trends over time — is performance improving or degrading release by release? Use these insights to 
justify technical debt prioritization and infrastructure investments. As your testing process matures, it will transition 
from reactive firefighting to proactive performance assurance.

**Goal:** Foster continuous improvement and build a sustainable, evolving load testing discipline that adds long-term value.
