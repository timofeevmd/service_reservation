# **1. Building a Load Testing Process for a Microservices Architecture**

## **1.1 Assessing the Initial Conditions: Solo Role and System Scope**

Load testing in a microservices architecture is always a complex task, especially when handled by a single engineer. Under 
such constraints, it's critical to evaluate your starting point: how many services are involved, what dependencies exist, 
how they scale, and where the potential failure points lie. If you're dealing with 8 microservices, each exposing REST APIs, 
you need to identify which are user-facing, which are internal, and which handle critical workflows. Also consider the 
availability of documentation, logging, monitoring, and tracing tools (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin). A crucial step is to create 
a service interaction map and define target scenarios that reflect real user behavior. This helps focus efforts on 
high-impact areas and avoids wasting resources on low-priority paths.

**Goal:** Establish a solid understanding of system architecture and define the testing scope within limited resources.

## **1.2 Planning the Load Testing Process Solo**

When you're the only person handling load testing, prioritization and automation become essential. 
Start with a strategy: what types of tests will you run (stability, stress, scalability, endurance), what metrics matter 
most (latency, throughput, error rate, resource usage), and how often tests will run across environments (dev/stage/prod-like). 
Tool selection is key — a consolidated solution like JMeter + InfluxDB + Grafana can streamline scenario execution, 
metric collection, and visualization. Design scenarios to be configurable, reusable, and version-controlled. Keep in mind, 
you'll be building tests, analyzing results, reporting findings, and coordinating with teams — so documentation and 
automation are your best allies.

**Goal:** Build a realistic and sustainable load testing plan tailored to solo execution and technical constraints.

## **1.3 Which Specialists Can Help and How**

Although you're the only load testing specialist, you're not working in a vacuum. Collaboration is key. Developers can 
explain business logic, API constraints, and code-level bottlenecks. DevOps engineers are essential for setting up monitoring 
(Prometheus, Grafana), accessing logs and metrics, and managing test environments. QA engineers can share test documentation,
critical use cases, and act as reviewers. Architects provide insights into service boundaries and SLA definitions. 
Learn to ask precise questions: “I need a log config,” “Where's the CPU metric for service X?” “Are there RPS limits on 
endpoint Y?” This way, you remain autonomous while leveraging others' expertise effectively.

**Goal:** Identify key contributors from other roles and learn to efficiently request and use their input without dragging 
them into day-to-day operations.
